# MindBox
A minimal library to make neural networks easier.

# Installation
```
pip install mindbox
```

### Quick Usage ‚è±
```
from mindbox.core import network
model = network()
model.dataset({'i':([1],[0]),'o':[0,1]})
model.train()
model.console()
```
Later, if you want to use your new created network, you can just type save on the console (after testing with the `model.console()` method)
```
[type "save"] [hit enter]
üì• Model saved as: model.weights


# Sometime after saving...

from mindbox.core import network
import numpy as np
model = network().load('your model name here or leave empty to use the default')

def predict(sequence):
    return np.average(model.predict([sequence])) 

print(predict([1])) # expect a number near to 0
```

### Description üìÑ
MindBox: is a simple Python library to make neural networks in seconds!
MindBox takes inspiration from minimal libraries like brain.js to make ML fun again. You can just go ahead and train a model in literally the time you take to walk to your kitchen...

The library automatically handles number of inputs for quick prototyping on real data. You can change customize the model as you please:<br>

```
> model.train(args)
    epochs        (50)   : number of times the model will see the full dataset
    learning_rate (.3)   : how fast the model will learn, a lower number ensures avoiding the well-known overfitting
    counter       (100)  : how many epochs should train before printing results
    threshold     (None) : stops training when the error (loss) rate is less than the threshold
```
